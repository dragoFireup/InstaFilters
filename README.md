Boomerang.py 
This code replicates the feature of Boomearng on instagram but only works on the system the code is running on.

Diminished.py

I really don't know what this filter is called its just that the image gets smaller and overlaps the original image. (If you know the name please do tell me).

Future Updates for Boomerang.py:
-> Make this a bit faster and try to merge it with few other filters

Future Updates for this Repository:
-> Added a few more filters
-> Run these filters on the cloud
-> Use those instanses on the cloud to use it in an app with the code of the app in this repository.
